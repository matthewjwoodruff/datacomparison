datacomparison
==============

Compare data tables stored in text files, to within a certain tolerance.

Pull requests are welcome, particularly for the following features:

* Do something intelligent with columns that aren't numbers.  Either compare or ignore.  Currently causes an error.
* Handle Inf / NaN.
* Is this a one-liner in `awk` like so many other analysis tasks?  Please share.
* Sensible options for output formatting.
